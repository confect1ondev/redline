There are two folders in this repository. **Redline** is a bare-bones, modular cybernetic enhancement tool for modpack makers that achieves full functionality with only Palladium and KubeJS. It offers a robust, data-driven system for content creators to develop their own cyberware items. For an example (or if you just want to try out Redline,) see the **Baseline** project.
